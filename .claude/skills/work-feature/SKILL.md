# Work Feature

Own the change through a reviewable PR.

1. Run the root `AGENTS.md` orientation gate. Confirm the branch is not protected, inspect status/remotes/history, and preserve unrelated work.
2. Read the closest nested instructions, `SECURITY.md`, indexed reference documents, and the full current path affected by the feature. Trace frontend, generated contract, backend, database/RLS, jobs, and tests as applicable.
3. If user behavior, scope, or a material tradeoff is unresolved, invoke `$brainstorm`/`/brainstorm`. If assumptions need aggressive challenge, invoke `$grillme`/`/grillme`. Do not use clarification as a substitute for discoverable repository facts.
4. Read `docs/agent-context/implementation-plan.md` and `docs/agent-context/feature-status.md`. Before the first implementation edit, tell the user the recommended available model and reasoning effort for the active agent with a one-sentence reason, mark exactly one plan item in progress, and define acceptance criteria, non-goals, compatibility requirements, security invariants, and a verification matrix. Create a concise plan for multi-step work.
5. Add or update a test that characterizes the behavior before or alongside the implementation whenever practical. Confirm a regression test fails for the intended reason before fixing a bug.
6. Implement the smallest cohesive change using existing boundaries and patterns. Keep generated artifacts generated and migrations additive.
7. Review the implementation for authorization, data isolation, PII, uploads, money movement, concurrency, failure modes, accessibility, and server/client exposure as relevant.
8. Run targeted checks during iteration and the full applicable verification from `AGENTS.md` before completion. Regenerate contracts and check the single Alembic head when applicable.
9. Update both living implementation records with fresh evidence, completion impact, PR linkage, and the next priority. Inspect `git diff`, `git diff --check`, and `git status`. Remove accidental debug output, secrets, unrelated files, and needless complexity.
10. Invoke `$review-pr`/`/review-pr`, address valid findings, then invoke `$ship`/`/ship` without waiting for a separate user request.
